Web frontend to the Veripeditus server

## What is Veripeditus?

Please see
[veripeditus-server](https://github.com/Veripeditus/veripeditus-server)
for that.

## Features of the web frontend

The web frontend was originally intended to provide a quick view into
the game state on a Veripeditus server. It has, however, developed to
become a full-featured client for playing.

Depending on how cool HTML5 turns out to be, it might become the
official client and thus the first real-world HTML5 location based
real-time game.

## Browser compatibility

The Veripeditus web frontend is developed and tested exactly on Mozilla
Firefox as there are no other free browsers that support HTML5 in a
reasonable way and can be entrusted with privacy critical data like
geolocation of a user.

Mozilla Firefox is available in any serious Linux distribution, as well
as for Android from the free [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org) app store.
Rumour has it that there is also a version for iOS.
